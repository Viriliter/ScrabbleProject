# Dictionary

A high-performance dictionary library that utilizes [directed acyclic word graphs (DAWGs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_acyclic_finite_state_automaton) for efficient word lookups and anagram finding.
The library is a reimplementation of Github repository of  [@cdot/dictionary](https://github.com/cdot/dictionary). It is a rewritten version in a Python language, inspired by the original project. 

For more information about the library, visit the original page [here](https://github.com/cdot/dictionary).
